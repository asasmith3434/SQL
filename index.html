  <h2> Data scientist vs. Computer scientist </h2>
<p> Data scinentists are usaully more focussed than a Computer Scientist, in the material which is used. Data requires a strong foundation
  in general business ethics and statistical math methods, in order to oberserve and work with data. Furthermore, data scientists follow
  a set of steps to reach a goal. Usually a scientist is faced with finding a trend in data and find a way to represent it in a way 
  for people to understand. These steps would involve Asking questions, Acquiring the data, prepping the data, Analyzing, creating a 
  fair visualization, communicating or explaining the data, and testing the model before implementation. Data scientists help people visualize
  data to solve a problem. On the other hand, Computer science is a general understanding of computer programs. Where the actual raw understanding
  of the used programs, languages, and ect. is needed to solve a problem. Furthermore, Computer Scientists have been involved in an older career
  field then Data Scientists, and the general fundamentals of computer science have been taught in school longer. Whereas, Data Science is
  a newer field which requires a unique set of skills. Therefore, the career field for Data Scientists is in a larger demand.

  <h2>Inner Join </h2>
<p>The Power Word Inner Join is able to consolidate columns of data into on set, which are located in differed data tables. For instance, the 
 wanted data would Select and use FROM to find the table. Then INNER JOIN would find the other table with the similiar SELECT column. 
  Furthermore, ON would be used to define the two columns, within the tables, as equaled to each other. Finally, WHERE could be used to find 
  the specific wanted data inside the columns. In conclusion, Inner Join helps display overlapping data found in different tables into one
  designated table.
